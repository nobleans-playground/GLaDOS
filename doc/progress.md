# TODO
currently working on:
- box on wheels
    - Using `webots_ros2_turtlebot` and `turtlebot3_navigation2` packages as example to build my own `glados_simulation` package, which I later want to split over `glados`, `glados_description` and `glados_simulation` packages.
    - working glados_simulation package: `ros2 launch glados_simulation simulation.py`
    - copying `robot_launch.py` elements to `simulation.py`
